The code base of this React application typically includes the following:

JSX - a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript files. This is used to define the structure of your components.

JavaScript - the main programming language used in a React application.

CSS - used to style your components.

npm (Node Package Manager) - used to manage dependencies and run scripts.

The structure of this react project consists of components, some of which were nested inside each other to create a hierarchy of components.

The major difficulty i experience was my inability to complete this project within the deadline given and as a result wasn't able to give my best. I will put in more effort if given the chance to prove myself again. and if not I will continue on the part to become a software developer as it is my passion. Thank you
